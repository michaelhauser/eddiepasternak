			Through Eddie Pasternak’s expert instruction students learn “systems” for chords, soloing,
			walking bass lines, chorded solos and music theory. You’ll learn how to quickly apply these
			“systems” in varied settings, from swinging standards to Jobim bossa/samba favorites.

		<h4>A note from Eddie:</h4>
		<p>
			“You’ll be delighted to learn some great ideas for technique, rhythm and harmony passed on by
			some of the world’s leading guitarists. I spent many years with Warren Nunes and had the good
			fortune to spend time with Joe Pass, Tuck Andress and most recently John Stowell. On the
			Brasilian side Marcos Silva has passed on invaluable information of that wonderful genre.
