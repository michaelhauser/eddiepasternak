![gualala-024](gualala-024.jpg)Whales & Jazz - Indeed !!! - The wailing was inside the Top of the Cliff Restaurant, Gualala as Eddie Pasternak & Roger Glenn packed them in for a Special Easter Adventure. Particularly delightful - Roger's "Take Five" & "Lullaby of Birdland", and Eddie's beautiful chorded solo tribute to guitarist Herb Ellis on "Easter Parade."       .....  Hugh Seatail
