Spring sailing, fabulous views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz, followed by the Raccoon Straits Jazz. The band, led by Ron Sfarzo on piano, Eddie Pasternak - guitar, Tom Duckworth - drums and Al Obidinski on bass, produced many smiles and showed off the added violin virtuosity of Carlos Reyes for a glorious afternoon.
