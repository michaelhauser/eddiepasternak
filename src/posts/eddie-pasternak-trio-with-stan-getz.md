Eddie Pasternak, Scott Steed, and Mary Fettig are joined by special guest Stan Getz at a birthday party.

I think it was 1988-- never realized the video was done until 2 yrs. back when a family member from the party mentioned a Beta-tape of the evening.. Stan had also signed a very nice note which unfortunately was lost in the Oakland Hill's fire...As a corny little extra...I played for 4yrs with drummer Dave Black one of the best ever.. Dave sent me a birthday card which was signed : "If you can Stan Getz you can Stan me."...I know -- corny as heck but I've loved the line and used it ever since..

..the party was for Bob Brown--realtor in Los Gatos...two months earlier I had met Stan at a Hillsborough party where I was playing solo guitar..he came up from behind, as I was head down, looking at my tuner..he said "do you play requests?"..my head head still at the tuner i replied if i knew the tune i'd play it..he adamantly replied "WRONG ANSWER!!"..I looked up doing a double take and said "you're not who i think you are are you?" then..with a look out of a Bela Lagossi movie he said "Iii AMm!"..ha, ha ..scared me..then proceeds to sit right in front of me during an entire dinner..at the end --most kindly, he said he wished he had his horn 'cause he liked all the tunes i'd selected..it was all pretty intimidating for i had only played a very few solo gigs at that point...Eddie
