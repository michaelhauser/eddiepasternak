Eddie Pasternak presents his trio with award winning Brazilian pianist - Marcos Silva, backing Grammy nominated violinist - Jeremy Cohen on Apr.30th and backing the Bay Area's best jazz vocalist - Kenny Washington on May.7th at Horizons Restaurant, Sausalito.

**As a regular feature during Eddie's 5 month stay at Yoshi's San Francisco. Marcos Silva continues to tear it up with the trio at Horizon's Sausalito where another great Brazilian pianist sergio mendes had graced the stage. "Always great to have Marcos as part of the band."  Ivan Lins used Marcos when he recently  recorded Jobim's Dindi and guitar great Chico Pinheiro uses him whenever he comes here from Sao Paulo. We're Honored. But that's not all - Eddie & Marcos will be at Horizon's with virtuoso violinist - Jeremy Cohen. Jeremy's group Quartet San Francisco has been up for numerous Grammy Awards in addition to being International Tango Competition winners. Jeremy is a crossover specialist bringing his classical virtuosity to jazz, tango, pop and gypsy swing.**
